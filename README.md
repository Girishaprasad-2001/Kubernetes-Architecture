### Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system. Its architecture is divided into two primary zones: the **Control Plane** and the **Worker Nodes**.

                       |           Control Plane           |
                       |  +-----------------------------+  |
                       |  | API Server                  |  |
                       |  | Scheduler                   |  |
                       |  | Controller Manager          |  |
                       |  | etcd                        |  |

                       +-----------------------------------+
                                         |
                                         |
                       +-----------------+-----------------+

                       |                                   |
        +-----------------------------+     +-----------------------------+

        |        Worker Node 1        |     |        Worker Node 2        |
        |  +-----------------------+  |     |  +-----------------------+  |
        |  | kubelet               |  |     |  | kubelet               |  |

        |  | Pods                  |  |     |  | Pods                  |  |
        |  +-----------------------+  |     |  +-----------------------+  |
        +-----------------------------+     +-----------------------------+

### 1. Control Plane (The Brain)

The Control Plane manages the worker nodes and the pods in the cluster. It makes global decisions, detects cluster events, and responds to them. 

* **API Server (kube-apiserver)**: The entry point for all administrative tasks. It exposes the Kubernetes API and validates configuration data.
* **Scheduler (kube-scheduler)**: Watches for newly created pods with no assigned node and selects a worker node for them to run on.
* **Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)**: Runs controller processes that regulate the state of the cluster (e.g., Node Controller, Job Controller).
* **etcd**: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

### 2. Worker Nodes (The Muscle)

Worker Nodes maintain running pods and provide the actual Kubernetes runtime environment. 

* **kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures that containers are running in a Pod according to the specifications.
* **kube-proxy**: A network proxy that runs on each node, maintaining network rules to allow network communication to your Pods.
* **Pods**: The smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. They host your containerized applications.
